For example, if you consider someone's name and phone number a piece of data, then the contact list on your phone would be a data structure. Or, you could think of your grocery list as a data structure, with each item on the list as a piece of data.\n",

For the purposes of this notebook we are going to take a look at the two most commonly used data structures in python: lists and tuples.\n",

    "All of these functions for adding, modifying, and removing items from a list can only operate on 1 element at a time. So, how do we make multiple changes to a list? Say, add 10 items to a list? For that, we need to use loops. Loops are used in computer programs to do the same (or, at least, similar) things multiple times. There are a wide variety of loops structures and syntax in different languages, but the most common loops fall into two categories: for loops, which do the same set of code a set number of times (add an element to a list 17 times, for example) and while loops, which do the same set of code until a boolean statement is false (add an element to a list until you have 100 elements, for example). Of these, the for loop is probably the most common, and it's what we'll focus on for this notebook. In python, the syntax for a for loop is similar to the syntax for an if statement, where you use the \"for\" command, followed by how many times to do the loop, and then all the indented lines below that command are run that many times. For example, here's how to print out all the individual elements in the instructor list: "
