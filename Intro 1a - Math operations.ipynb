When you first started learning division in school you probably didn't worry about fractions or decimals, but instead worried about remainders. Integer division and modulo operators are essentially this type of division. For example, instead of saying $\\frac{22}{7}$=3.1429..., I can instead say that $\\frac{22}{7}$=3r1 (3 with a remainder of 1). Integer division (the // operator) will give me the 3, while the modulo operator (represented by the % symbol) will give me the 1:"
